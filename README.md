I developed a bubble game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript in which the user has to find target numbers within a set of options within a 60-second timeframe. When the user clicks on the correct number, both the target and score are updated. Clicking on the wrong number updates the target, adding an element of difficulty and making the game more challenging, as the sequence changes with each click. Finally, the userâ€™s score is displayed at the end.
